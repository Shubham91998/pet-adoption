            question: "Why Should You Adopt a Dog or Cat?",
            answer: `Did you know that over 2000 people per hour in India run a search right here looking to adopt a pet? 
              Pet adoption is becoming the preferred way to find a new pet. Adoption will always be more convenient than buying a 
              puppy for sale from a pet shop or finding a kitten for sale from a litter. Pet adoption brings less stress and 
              more savings! So what are you waiting for? Go find that perfect pet for home!`,
          },
          {
            question: "What is the fee to adopt a pet?",
            answer: `No, there is no fee for pet adoption on <a href="/" target="_blank">ThePetNest</a>. However, if you adopt from a different city, the pet owner/rescuer 
              can ask for travel charges. In case you find someone asking for charges, you can write to us at 
              <a href="mailto:support@thepetnest.com">support@thepetnest.com</a>.`,

          },
          {
            question: "Can you return an adopted pet?",
            answer: `We understand it can be hard to get an adjusted pet in the new home and vice versa. As long as your reason for 
              returning is reasonable, youâ€™ll be welcome to put it up for adoption again.`,
